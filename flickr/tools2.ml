(* 

   This is an upload algorithm which suits the author's personal situation. 
   This may not fit with your purpose at all! Be careful. Read the source!

   * Currently this is just for uploading. No real syncing is provided.

   * In one photoset, media(photos/videos) are identified by their title.

   * Titles of media are their basenames without file extension:
     "foo" for "directory/foo.jpg" and "bar" for "dir/bar.mpg".

   * Therefore, you CANNOT have files like "family.jpg" and "family.mpg"
     in one photoset. If one of them is uploaded, then the other is simply
     skipped and never uploaded. 
     There is no safety check of this (for the moment).

   * Currently there is no syncing. Even if your local media are
     modified, the updated versions are never uploaded until the corresponding
     files are removed from the photoset by some other means.

   Algorithm:

   * A medium is uploaded with the following informatin:

     * Title: its basename without extension
     * Tags: "uploading" and "photoset_<photoset>"

   * If uploading is successful, the medium is added to the photoset.

   * If the photoset addition is successful, the tag "uploading" is removed.

   * For one medium, the function tries to recover communication errors
     at most 2 times (i.e. 3 trials).

   Things to do

   * If a photoset addition fails, there remains a medium with "uploading"
     tag which is not in any photoset. It should be recovred by "getNotInSet"
     method and add into the appropriate photoset in later trials. 

   * If a medium is added to the photoset but if "uploading" tag removal
     fails, the medium remains in the photoset with the tag. It is not critical
     but the function should clean the tag in later trials.
